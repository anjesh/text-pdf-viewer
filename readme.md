Text and PDF Comparer
=====================
This is a very crude implementation of text and PDF viewer so that they could be compared side by side - after text extraction from the pdf. It uses quill.js for the editor and pdf.js for the PDF viewer. 

Data should be present in the data folder with text files inside text folder and pdfs in the pages folder.
